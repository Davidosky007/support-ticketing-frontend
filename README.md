- View all submitted tickets and their statuses
- Add comments to existing tickets
- Receive email notifications on ticket updates

### Agent Features
- View a dashboard of assigned and unassigned tickets
- Assign tickets to themselves
- Update ticket status (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed)
- Add comments to tickets
- Export ticket data to CSV format
- Receive daily email reminders about open tickets

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Ember.js 4.x
- **API**: GraphQL
- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails API (separate repository)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16.x or later)
- npm (v8.x or later)
- Git

For the backend service (separate repository):
- Ruby 3.2.x
- Rails 7.x
- PostgreSQL

## Installation

### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Davidosky007/support-ticketing-frontend.git
   cd support-ticketing-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the backend repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Davidosky007/support-ticketing-backend.git
   cd support-ticketing-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   rails db:seed  # Optional: adds sample data
   ```

## Configuration

### Frontend Configuration

The frontend is configured to connect to the backend API at `https://support-ticketing-backend.onrender.com/graphql` by default. 

If you need to connect to a local backend or different deployment, modify the `baseUrl` in the Apollo service:

```javascript
// app/services/apollo.js
export default class ApolloService extends Service {
  // ...
  baseUrl = 'https://your-backend-url/graphql';
  // ...
}
```

Additionally, update the Content Security Policy in `config/environment.js` to allow connections to your backend:

```javascript
// config/environment.js
contentSecurityPolicy: {
  'connect-src': "'self' https://your-backend-url"
},
```

### Backend Configuration

For the backend, you'll need to set up environment variables:

1. Create a `.env` file in the backend project root:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost/support_ticketing_dev
   JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret
   SMTP_SERVER=smtp.example.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
   SMTP_PASSWORD=your_email_password
   MAIL_FROM=support@yourdomain.com
   ```

2. Adjust CORS settings in `config/initializers/cors.rb` if needed.

## Running the Application

### Frontend Development Server

Start the Ember development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the application at `http://localhost:4200`.

### Backend Development Server

Start the Rails server:

```bash
rails server
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000/graphql`.

## Testing

### Frontend Tests

Run the test suite with:

```bash
npm test
```

For linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Backend Tests

Run the backend test suite with:

```bash
rspec
```

## GraphQL API Reference

The application uses a GraphQL API for all data operations. For detailed API documentation, see [graphql-api-ember-guide.md](./graphql-api-ember-guide.md) in this repository.

Key API operations include:

- Authentication (login/register)
- Creating and retrieving tickets
- Adding comments
- Uploading attachments
- Assigning tickets to agents
- Updating ticket status
- Generating reports

## Deployment

### Frontend Deployment

The frontend can be deployed to any static hosting service:

1. Build the production assets:
   ```bash
   npm run build --environment=production
   ```

2. Deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to your hosting service.

Popular hosting options include:
- Netlify
- Vercel
- GitHub Pages
- Firebase Hosting

### Backend Deployment

Alright, so you've got your shiny frontend ready - now let's talk about getting that backend up and running in production! 

You'll need a hosting service that can handle Ruby on Rails. Here's what you need to do:

1. Set up those environment variables - trust me, you don't want to forget this step ðŸ™ƒ
2. Deploy your Rails app (fingers crossed for a smooth deploy!)
3. Run those database migrations - because nobody likes a schema mismatch error at 2 AM

We've had good experiences with these hosting services:
- Heroku (classic choice, though the free tier is sadly gone)
- Render (pretty solid and developer-friendly)
- Fly.io (super fast if you configure it right)
- Railway (surprisingly easy to use)

## Troubleshooting

Let's be honest - things will break. Here's how to fix them when they do!

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Issues

- **Problem**: You're 100% sure you typed your password right, but you're still getting "Invalid login credentials" 
  **Solution**: First, take a deep breath! Then check if your backend API is actually running. Double-check your JWT secret - this one has bitten us more times than we'd like to admit.

- **Problem**: You're working away and suddenly... you're logged out. Again. ðŸ˜¤
  **Solution**: Your JWT token is probably expiring too quickly. We've all been there! Check the token expiration time in your backend. Maybe don't set it to 5 minutes during development (lesson learned the hard way).

#### API Connection Issues

- **Problem**: GraphQL queries fail with network errors
  **Solution**: 
  1. Verify the backend URL in `app/services/apollo.js`
  2. Check CORS settings on the backend
  3. Ensure your backend server is running

#### CSV Export Issues

- **Problem**: CSV export button doesn't download anything
  **Solution**: 
  1. Check that the date range is valid (not in the future)
  2. Verify the browser console for errors
  3. Ensure the backend has permission to create and serve files

- **Problem**: "No download URL was returned" error
  **Solution**: This may indicate a server-side issue. Check the backend logs.

#### File Upload Issues

- **Problem**: File attachments fail to upload
  **Solution**:
  1. Check file size limits in both frontend and backend
  2. Verify the correct encoding is being used (Base64)
  3. Ensure proper CORS headers are set for file uploads

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered here, please:

1. Open an issue in the GitHub repository
2. Include detailed error messages and steps to reproduce
3. Check the browser console and backend logs for error details
